# Haze – Speedfest XIV Pylon Racing UAV 

## Overview
Haze is a high-performance pylon racing UAV designed and built by a 16-member senior aerospace engineering team for the Speedfest XIV competition(I was a member of the structures team) . The aircraft was developed to compete in:

- Pylon Racing Performance
- Aerobatic Demonstration (with smoke system)
- Marketing Presentation

The aircraft was fully designed, modeled, structurally analyzed, manufactured, and flight-tested by the team.

## Mission Objectives
- Design a competitive two-stroke internal combustion pylon racing aircraft
- Maximize straight-line speed and pylon cornering performance
- Integrate an onboard smoke system for aerobatic demonstration
- Ensure structural survivability under high-G maneuvering
- Compete head-to-head against a rival team aircraft

## Propulsion & Systems Integration

- Engine: DA-35 two-stroke internal combustion engine
- Electronic ignition system
- Integrated fuel and oil tanks
- Onboard smoke system for aerobatic performance
- Receiver and battery-powered avionics system

The propulsion system required structural reinforcement to manage vibration and thrust loads transmitted into the fuselage.

## Flight Control System

- 1 Rudder servo
- 1 Elevator servo
- 1 Aileron servo
- 1 Throttle servo
- High-tech servos (0.044 lb each)

Mechanical Linkages:
- Super ball horns
- 4-40 pushrods

Control surfaces were mechanically actuated and tuned to ensure precise response during high-speed racing and high-G aerobatic maneuvers.

## Structural Design Considerations

As a member of the Structures Team, I contributed to:

- Wing load path development for up to 16 G loading
- Fuselage reinforcement for propulsion-induced vibration
- Structural packaging of internal systems
- Weight optimization while preserving strength margins
- Cross-team integration with CAD and Aerodynamics groups

Designing for 16 G capability required careful consideration of:
- Spar sizing
- Attachment points
- Control surface hinge loads
- Engine mounting loads
- Fuel mass effects on CG during flight

## Engineering Challenges

- Achieving 126 mph while maintaining structural integrity
- Managing vibration from a two-stroke engine
- Balancing strength vs. weight at a 7.55 lb dry mass
- Packaging fuel, oil, smoke, and avionics within a 48-inch fuselage
- Maintaining stable CG across fuel burn conditions

---

## Results

The aircraft successfully:
- Achieved 126 mph top speed
- Sustained high-load aerobatic maneuvers
- Competed in pylon racing events
- Performed aerobatic demonstrations with integrated smoke system
- Represented a fully integrated multidisciplinary aerospace design effort

## Tools Used
- SolidWorks (Full aircraft CAD modeling and layout)
- Structural load analysis and hand calculations
- Cross-team design reviews
- Flight testing and performance validation
