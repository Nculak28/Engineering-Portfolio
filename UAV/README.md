# UAV Project

## Overview
Haze is a high-performance pylon racing UAV designed and manufactured by a 16-member senior aerospace engineering team for the Speedfest XIV competition (I was apart of the Structures team) . The aircraft was built to compete in:

- High-speed pylon racing
- Aerobatic demonstration (integrated smoke system)
- Technical and marketing presentation

The project involved full conceptual design, aerodynamic analysis, structural sizing, propulsion integration, manufacturing, and competitive flight testing.

## Configuration Selection & Aerodynamic Rationale

### High-Wing Configuration
The high-wing layout was selected for several reasons:

- Structurally efficient spar pass-through without interfering with internal systems
- Reduced frontal interference compared to mid-wing packaging
- Improved ground clearance for belly landings
- Simplified fuselage integration
- Wing doubling as an access hatch for internal components

### Conventional Tail
A conventional tail configuration was chosen for:

- Simplicity in manufacturing
- Predictable aerodynamic behavior
- Horizontal stabilizer placement in propeller wash for improved low-speed control authority

### Airfoil Selection
The main wing utilized the NACA 2412 airfoil, selected for:

- Moderate camber for lift generation
- Adequate thickness for structural spar integration
- Favorable lift-to-drag performance at racing Reynolds numbers

### Stability & Trim
- Center of gravity positioned at the quarter chord for longitudinal stability
- Horizontal stabilizer incidence set to -1° to address trim and cruise stability
- CFD analysis performed on the cowling to evaluate inlet airflow and cooling behavior

## Structural Design

### Load Design
The aircraft was structurally designed to withstand up to 16 G maneuver loads during racing and aerobatics.

Primary considerations included:
- Wing root bending moments
- Engine thrust and vibration loads
- Control surface hinge moments
- Fuel mass variation effects on CG

### Wing Spar Design
Main spar construction:
- 1/8 in Sitka spruce shear web
- 0.01 in unidirectional carbon fiber caps (1 in width)

This hybrid design provided:
- High bending stiffness
- Efficient weight distribution
- Strong tensile/compressive capability at spar caps

### Fuselage Construction
- Thin aerodynamic balsa primary structure
- Reinforced with layered fiberglass
- Lightweight composite approach for strength-to-weight optimization

Material testing was conducted to validate component selections for structural performance.

---

## Manufacturing Process

Three primary molds were designed in SolidWorks after full aircraft modeling:

1. Fuselage + vertical stabilizer mold
2. Main wing mold
3. Horizontal stabilizer mold

### Mold Fabrication Process
- CNC machined from high-density foam
- Primed and sanded
- Two layers of gel coat applied
- Sharp corners reinforced with colloidal epoxy
- 13 layers of tooling fiberglass laid over gel coat

This process enabled repeatable composite fabrication and structural consistency.

## Flight Control System

- 1 Rudder servo
- 1 Elevator servo
- 1 Aileron servo
- 1 Throttle servo
- High-tech servos (0.044 lb each)

Mechanical linkages:
- Super ball horns
- 4-40 pushrods

The control system was tuned for precision handling at speeds up to 126 mph and under high-G maneuvering loads.

---

## Propulsion & Systems Integration

- DA-35 two-stroke internal combustion engine
- Electronic ignition
- Integrated fuel and oil tanks
- Onboard smoke system
- Receiver and battery avionics system

Engine vibration and thrust loads were structurally integrated into the fuselage reinforcement scheme.

## Team Organization

The project was divided into:

- Chief Engineer (system-level integration)
- CAD Team (full aircraft modeling and packaging)
- Aerodynamics Team (airfoil selection, stability analysis, CFD)
- Propulsion Team (engine integration and fuel system)
- Structures Team (load analysis, spar design, material selection, structural validation, manufacturinf)

Cross-team coordination ensured proper CG management, packaging efficiency, and structural integrity.
