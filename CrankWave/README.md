# Crankshaft- Wave Motion Project
# Heroes Moving Panel – Mechanical Engineering Project

## Overview
This project I led in 2022, it involved designing and constructing a large-scale mechanical display to animate the word **“HEROES”** as part of Oklahoma State University’s homecoming tradition. The goal was to create a visually dynamic panel where oversized letters move in a coordinated wave motion.

## Key Features
- Custom **crankshaft mechanism** driven by an AC motor to generate smooth wave-like motion for the letters.  
- **Rebar-built letters** mounted on **pillow block bearings**, allowing them to roll smoothly along **custom angle iron tracks**.  
- Panel dimensions: approximately **15–16 feet high** and **10 feet wide**, with letters that move in a synchronized, continuous wave pattern.  
- Letters equipped with **balls/wheels at their base** to ensure consistent motion along the tracks.

## Engineering & Design
- Full **CAD design in SOLIDWORKS**, leveraging the **weldments feature** to model square tubing, circular rods, and rebar letters.  
- Detailed **material estimation and procurement** for square tubing, rebar, angle iron, circular rods, and fasteners.  
- Custom fabrication plans for **crankshaft geometry**, ensuring precise kinematics to produce the desired letter motion.  
- Incorporated **mechanical components** such as pillow block bearings, screws, bolts, and structural supports for durability.

## Fabrication & Tools
- **Welding:** MIG and TIG welding used for assembling square tubing frames and attaching circular rods to the crankshaft.  
- **Cutting:** Electric saws used to cut square tubing, angle iron, and circular rods to precise lengths.  
- **Assembly:** Screws, bolts, and fasteners of various sizes used to secure structural components and letters.  
- **Bearings:** Pillow block bearings installed to allow smooth rotation of letters along tracks.  
- **Tracks:** Custom angle iron tracks designed and installed to guide the motion of the letters.

## Leadership & Collaboration
- Led a **team of eight skilled welders and fabricators**, coordinating construction and assembly.  
- Oversaw **all engineering aspects**, including design validation, material selection, and final assembly.  
- Managed procurement, fabrication timelines, and quality control for the entire project.

## Technologies & Tools
- **SOLIDWORKS** – CAD design, weldments, motion planning  
- **Metal fabrication tools** – welding equipment, electric saws, hand tools  
- **Mechanical components** – AC motor, crankshaft, rebar letters, pillow block bearings, wheels/balls  
- **Fasteners** – screws, bolts, and various mounting hardware

## Outcome
The project successfully brought the **“HEROES”** panel to life, combining **engineering precision, mechanical ingenuity, and large-scale fabrication**. The final product became a centerpiece of the Oklahoma State University homecoming tradition, demonstrating both technical skill and team leadership.
